Answer: Based on the question and the provided context, here are the movies that match the criteria:

1. The Great Train Robbery (1978)
   - Plot: "In Victorian England, a master criminal makes elaborate plans to steal a shipment of gold from a moving train."
   - Runtime: 110 minutes
   - Year: 1978

The context provided does not include any movies with a runtime of 100 minutes and a release year of 1970 related to train robberies. The closest match is "Illusive Tracks" from 2003, but it does not fit the exact criteria given in the question.

Conclusions:
- The question cannot be fully answered with the provided context, as there are no movies that match the criteria of "runtime=100" and "year=1970" for a train robbery plot.
- The context includes several movies related to train robberies or heists, such as "The Great Train Robbery" (1978) and "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" (1974 and 2009), but they do not match the specific parameters given in the question.

To fully address the question, more information or a broader set of movie data would be needed to find any potential matches for the given criteria.
